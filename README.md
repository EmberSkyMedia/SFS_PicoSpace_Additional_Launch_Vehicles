# SFS_PicoSpace_Additional Launch Vehicles
PicoSpace Additional Launch Vehicles is my SfS Recreation pack which comprises of the following launch vehicles for Spaceflight Simulator.
- SLS Block 1, 1B, 2
- Ares 1, IV, V
- Atlas V - 400 and 500 series
- Delta IV Program

Spacecraft Companion Pack
- Orion Space Capsule, Heat Shield, and European Service Module

My goal with these recreations is that they are 100% clickable so staging is not required (although very helpful, especially if you need to abort or detach boosters).

Planned Updates:

V3 - Expand Back in time for Delta and Atlas and Forward with Vulcan/Jupiter and further afield with Launch Vehicles around the world.

REQUIREMENT: You will need my Latest Engine Pack for the Engines and Boosters for the Boosters.
