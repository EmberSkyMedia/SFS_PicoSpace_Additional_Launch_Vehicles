# SFS_PicoSpace_Artemis
PicoSpace Artemis SLS Recreation which currently comprises of the Block 1 variant of the SLS project.

My goal with these recreations is that they are 100% clickable (only the RS-25 engines currently need to be stacked/clipped and stagged).

Planned Updates:

V2 - To correct any Block 1 Errors, Added Blocks 1B and 2, Engine Stacking (so you don't have to use Part Clipping)

V3 - To add a lander (based on best information gathering) and Constellation Variant

REQUIREMENT: You will need my Latest Engine Pack for the Engines
