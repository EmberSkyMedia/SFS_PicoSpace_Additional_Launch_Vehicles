# SFS_PicoSpace_Additional Launch Vehicles
PicoSpace Additional Launch Vehicles is my SfS Recreation pack which comprises of the following launch vehicles for Spaceflight Simulator.
- SLS Block 1, 1B, 2
- Ares 1, IV, V
- Atlas V - 400 and 500 series
- Delta IV Program

Spacecraft Companion Pack
- Orion Space Capsule, Heat Shield, and European Service Module
- Dragon 1 & 2 Systems with additional Toggles for Firefly and Red Dragon (Mars)
- Starliner Capsule, Heat Shield, and Service Module
- Credesign Lunar Lander  (one part + Utilities Pack Items + Pegion Hawk Breeze Engine from Engines Pack)
- Seek's Salamander Mars Lander (two parts + Utilities Pack Items + Might Owl Engine from Engines Pack)
- Reusable 2nd Stage For Falcons with Petal Fairings

My goal with these recreations is that they are 100% clickable so staging is not required (although very helpful, especially if you need to abort or detach boosters).
